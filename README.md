Iceland Atlantis
==========

##### Files, scripts, and notes related to the Icelandic implementation of the [Atlantis](http://atlantis.cmar.csiro.au/) model.
 
The purpose of this repository to allow sharing of scripts and files between the Icelandic case study partners and EU partners on the [EU MareFrame project](http://www.mareframe-fp7.org/). In addition, it is my hope that `R` scripts on this site may be of use to researchers working with **Atlantis** or fisheries models, in general. 

* Modelling domain shapefiles are in Lambert 1993 and WGS 1984 projection. They are located in the l93 and wgs84 directories, respectively. 
* Depth contours were derived from NOAA's IBCAO version 3.0 using [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/). The original grid file and a README.txt are found [here](http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/bathymetry/arctic/grids/version3_0/). These are again in Lambert 1993 and WGS 1984 projection.
* Shapefiles of Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroes Islands are from[GADM](http://www.gadm.org). They may be used for *non-commerical purposes* and *may not be redistributed without permission*. Again, they are in Lambert 1993 and WGS 1984 projection.
